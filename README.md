The "Four Rooms" scenario is a classic reinforcement learning problem. A simple environment is used to illustrate and test different algorithms, where an agent (like a robot) must navigate a grid-like space with four distinct rooms to reach a goal state. This must be done while avoiding obstacles. 

This project uses a greedy algorithm to solve different four room scenarios.
